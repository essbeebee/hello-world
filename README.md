github tutorial


Hey, nobody is going to read this~
I am completely new to programming and am super motivated to get into it!
I am a current high school student and am self-studying a bit of bash rn
This is also my first programming language!
If for some absurd reason you are reading this, and are familiar with bash,
feel free to add me as a friend if thats a thing on github~
